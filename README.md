# Android_App
this is my frist android app project title:'DealDive Development Roadmap' with kotlin language 

Phase 1: Project Setup (1 week)
- Open Android Studio → New Project → Empty Compose Activity (or Empty Activity if you prefer XML).
- Choose Kotlin as the language.
- Enable necessary Jetpack libraries in build.gradle (Hilt, Room, Retrofit, WorkManager, Compose).
Example dependencies block (app-level build.gradle):
        implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui:1.x.x"
        implementation "com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.x.x"
        implementation "androidx.room:room-runtime:2.x.x"
        implementation "androidx.hilt:hilt-navigation-compose:1.x.x"
        implementation "androidx.work:work-runtime-ktx:2.x.x"

Phase 2: Define App Architecture (1 week)
- Adopt MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel) with a Repository layer.
- Create modules/packages:
- data (Room entities, DAOs, Retrofit services)
- domain (repository interfaces, models)
- ui (screens, viewmodels)
- Integrate Hilt for dependency injection.

Phase 3: Build Core UI Screens (2 weeks)
- Home Screen
- Compose/TextField search bar
- LazyRow/LazyColumn for “Trending Deals” cards
- Product List
- Card layout showing image, price, discount badge
- Click navigates to Detail Screen via Navigation Compose
- Detail Screen
- Show product image, name, price history chart (use MPAndroidChart or Compose Charts)
- “Track Price” button to open price-alert slider
Workflows:
- Define sealed UiState in ViewModels.
- Expose LiveData/StateFlow to Composables.

Phase 4: Networking & Data Fetching (2 weeks)
- Create Retrofit interfaces for at least one e-commerce API (or mock JSON).
- Use OkHttp interceptors to log requests.
- Parse responses into ProductDto → map to domain models.
- In Repository, implement suspend fun fetchProducts(query: String): List<Product>.
Test with simple UI:
- Hook up a search action to call your fetch function.
- Display returned list in Product List screen.

Phase 5: Local Caching with Room (1 week)
- Define @Entity data classes for Product and PriceHistory.
- Build DAOs (insertProduct(), getProductsByQuery(), insertPriceHistory()).
- In Repository, combine network and DB:
- On fetch, write to DB.
- On offline or stale data, serve from DB.
Validate by turning off Wi-Fi and confirming cached results still show.

Phase 6: Background Price Checks (1 week)
- Use WorkManager to schedule periodic work (e.g., every 6 hours).
- In your Worker, fetch tracked items from Room, call API, compare prices, write new history.
- Expose a Flow in ViewModel so UI updates automatically after each run.

Phase 7: Notifications & Alerts (1 week)
- For local alerts, use Android’s Notification API.
- When a price threshold is breached in your Worker, build a notification channel and show a push.
- (Optional) Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging to handle remote notifications.
Test by manually triggering a Worker with a known price drop.

Phase 8: AI Deal Predictor (2 weeks)
- Collect past price data, train a simple TensorFlow Lite model to forecast short-term dips.
- Bundle the .tflite in assets/.
- In Repository, load TFLite interpreter:
     Interpreter(loadModelFile(context, "deal_predictor.tflite"))
- Expose a suspend fun predictBestBuyDate(product: Product): LocalDate.
Show the predicted date on the Detail Screen.

Phase 9: UI/UX Polish (2 weeks)
- Create a Figma file with your color palette, typography, and component library.
- Add Material theming, dark mode support, motion animations for transitions.
- Polish charts, buttons, and card elevations.
- Implement dynamic theming (light/dark) using Compose MaterialTheme.

Phase 10: Testing & QA (1 week)
- Write unit tests for ViewModels and Repository logic (use JUnit + MockK).
- UI tests with Compose Testing APIs.
- Manual device tests on emulator and a physical Android device.
Fix UI edge cases (long names, missing images), handle network errors gracefully.

Phase 11: Prepare for Launch (1 week)
- Create app icons (adaptive launcher icon) and feature graphics.
- Sign your APK/AAB with a release key.
- Draft Play Store listing: title, short/long descriptions, screenshots, promo video.
- Upload to Google Play Console as an internal test track—gather feedback.
- Roll out to production once approved.
